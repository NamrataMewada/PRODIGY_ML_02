# K-Means Clustering for Retail Store Customer Segmentation

### Project Overview
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history and demographic information. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can be targeted for personalized marketing strategies. Here we segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the Silhouette Score is calculated to evaluate the clustering performance.

### Dataset: 
The dataset contains information on 200 customers, including:

* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
* Gender: Gender of the customer
* Age: Age of the customer
* Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars
* Spending Score (1-100): Customer's spending score, based on the company's judgment of their spending behavior

## Procedure
* Data Preprocessing
* Determining the optimal clusters
* Applying K-means Clustering
* Evaluating the model
* Testing the mdoel with the new data
